Always use patsy language

the model.pkl files (which can be user-def names) hold the model as well
as the string used to do the fit

with --fit model.pkl
saves model in model.pkl and displays rms R^2 and cross_val scores
as well as the original string used to do the fit and the type of model


with --predict model.pkl
loads model, input and shows _fit variable to the dataframe
with --stats, does same thing, but displays rms and R2
with --hist shows hist of residuals
with --plot shows fit vs residual

of course classifiers have their own metrics and maybe have a
--roc that plots the roc curve

with
--info model.pkl, just shows the model

with --desc 'my desc'  allows you to store a description that will be
                       displayed with the --info flag
