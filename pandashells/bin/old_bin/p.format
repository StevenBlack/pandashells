I intend this to be a file that allows for simplifying input to p.parallel


cat file.csv | p.format '{fn} {fn} {fn}' 

this will take a dataframe and print a string with the given output
Note that output will not be a dataframe, but simply a bunch of strings.

May require duplicating output writer code.
